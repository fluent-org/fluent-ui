# Icon

Fluent-UI Svg Icons Based on [RemixIcon](https://remixicon.com/).

## Imports

You can import the icons with one of these two options:

- Option 1:
`
import BankFillIcon from '@fluent-ui/icons/BankFill';
`

- Option 2:
`
import { BankFillIcon as BankFillIcon } from '@fluent-ui/icons'
`

The safest is option 1 but option 2 can yield the best developer experience. Make sure you follow the [minimizing bundle size](/getting-started/minimizing-bundle-size) guide before using the second approach.
